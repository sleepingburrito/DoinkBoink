Doink Boink Quick Start Guide
The goal of the game is to hit your opponent with the ball more times than they hit you.

Xbox controllers (360/One) Or Keyboard

Analog and Dpad (is an 8 directions game)
Left/Right: Moves left and right while on the ground or in the air. Press against a wall to hold onto it. When throwing a ball it can be used to pick a directions.

Up: When on a wall it can be used climb up a wall. While throwing it can be used to throw upwards.

Down: When on the ground the player will duck. Ducking makes you smaller and can help dodge balls. Ducking also slows the player down quicker causing less sliding. If the player jumps while ducking, they will get a higher than normal jump.

Face Buttons
B: Jumps, pressing A while in the air gives you a double jump. Jumping while holding onto a wall will give the player a wall jump.

A: Used for a dodge/counter attack with the ball if the player does not have the ball already. When the button is pressed the player will go into a block and a ball thrown at the player will bounce off. If the other player is hit with this ball then the blocker scores. If the player does have the ball and goes into block, the other player will not be able to steal the ball from the blocker. Blocking also caused the player to bounce if they hit a wall.

X: Picks up/steals/charges/throws the ball. If the player does not have the ball it will pick up the ball from the ground or steal the ball from the other player when in contact with the ball. If you catch a ball in a small time window after the other player throws the ball, it becomes super charged. Throwing the ball while it’s super charged will cause the ball to fly out at max power. Note you do not need to charge the ball when its super charged. It will throw at max speed regardless of the charge level.

Once the player has the ball, holding the button down will bring the player into a charge mode. The longer you hold the ball in charge mode, the more speed the ball will have once you let go of the button. Once you hit max charge the ball will throw automatically.  Pressing dodge while charging will cancel out of a charge throw.

Start: Can pause/un-pause the game.
